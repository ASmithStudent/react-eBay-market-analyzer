### OVERIVEW
This is a simple eBay market price analyzer built with React + Chart.js
* It works by making AJAX calls and getting data through the eBay API.
* It aims to provide market information to the users before they buy/sell items on eBay, where the price of the items can vary greatly
* Due to the limitation of the eBay API, only the recent 90 days of sales data is available.
* This project has been configured and can be directly deployed on Heroku
